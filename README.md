# Plant-Disease

This project aims to build a deep learning-based image classification system capable of identifying plant diseases from leaf images. Using the Plant-Village dataset, a CNN model is trained to recognize patterns associated with various plant diseases across different crop types. The system supports disease classification for select crops like tomato, potato, and pepper. Additionally, a Streamlit-based web application provides a simple graphical interface for end users to upload images and obtain real-time diagnostic feedback.

The Project has been explained in the report.
